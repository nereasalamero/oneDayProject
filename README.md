###:
Code of the One-Day Project, part of User Interface Programming subject.

The topic we had to develop was a Movie/TV show search, more specifically an interface to search movies or TV shows with details like ratings, genres, and descriptions fetched from an API.

We have developed this application using the Flet framework and integrating it with the TMDB (The Movie DataBase) API. Users can search for movies and TV shows, filtering them by types and they can visualize the details of the films, such as its ratings, genres and descriptions.
